# 🍕 Pizzeria React App

Welcome to the **Adkins Pizzeria React App**, a dynamic and user-friendly pizza ordering simulator! Built with React and styled using Bootstrap, this app allows users to build custom pizzas, manage their order, and see a live-updating receipt with tax, tip, and optional rewards points.

Adapted from the original Java Pizzeria code in my GitHub repo below:
